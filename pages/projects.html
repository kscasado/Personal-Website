      <small> Created image processing to detect craters given a image from the Hirise Satellite. This was done for
        the senior capstone project and contracted through JPL, the code for which is on a private repository on github. Most of my work
      was in the pipeline to recieve the input from the Mars Satellite and the Machine Learning for crater recognition.</small>

        <small> Created a game in python that acts as a staged shooter, as birds fly by you shoot at them across the screen.
          The purpose of this game was to gain more understanding with python and also get more familiar with things such as collision detection
        and animation in games.</small>
