      <small> Created image processing to detect craters given a image from the Hirise Satellite. This was done for
        the senior capstone project and contracted through JPL, the code for which is on a private repository on github. Most of my work
      was in the pipeline to recieve the input from the Mars Satellite and the Machine Learning for crater recognition.</small>
